## Brief Overview

My name is Levi Todes, I was born and raised in South Africa. I grew up in Cape Town which means I spent a lot of time outdoors. I enjoy most sports and outdoor activities, with a particular interest in Football, Hiking, Surfing, Cricket, Rugby and Cycling. I moved to Chicago in August 2018 and am currently completing my Masters in Robotics at Northwestern University. I did my undergraduate degree in mechatronics at the University of Cape Town and I particularly enjoy digital electronics and programming.

## Education

### Bachelor of Science in Engineering Mechatronics - University of Cape Town

Enrolled Feb 2014 – Graduated Dec 2017.

### Master of Science in Robotics - Northwestern University

Enrolled Sep 2018 - (Expected) Graduated Dec 2019

## Experience


### Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Group | Intern  - *(Nov – Dec 2016)*

I had an internship in the Bioelectronics and Neuroscience (BENS) Research Program at the
University of Western Sydney. The projects that I was involved in were:
* Design and construction of a Piezo-electric sensing board that can determine where on a board a ping pong ball has bounced.
* Developing the code to control a multi-axial automated camera rig, eventually getting the system to track a light/sound and ultimately track movement.

### Cape Peninsula University of technology | Practical Training  - *(Nov 2014)*

I attended a practical training course at the Cape Peninsula University of Technology. There
I learnt: to arc weld; to use a lathe machine; design automation with pneumatics; applied
metrology; CNC machining; heat tempering and hardening; and Computer Aided Drafting

### Balancell | Interim Job - *(May - August 2018)*

Prior to my moving to Chicago for my masters degree, I worked at an engineering startup in Cape Town, South Africa called Balancell. Their focus is on building 'smart' Lithium Ferro Phosphate Battery Packs for industrial use. My role was to develop test rigs (designing and building circuits and programming micro-controllers) for their equipment and circuits.
