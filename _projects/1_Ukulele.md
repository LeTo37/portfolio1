## Overview
My winter quarter project, currently ongoing, is to design. build and program an autonomous Ukulele Player. 

### Approach
The basic approach I am following is to develop a 4x4 bank of solenoids to be housed above a small section of the ukkulele neck, placed above a part of the ukulele whereby this bank of solenoids will be able to press a pretty comprehensive combination of notes/chords, enough to be able to play most, if not all songs.

### Further Reading
While this project is being done, updates will be posted [here](https://github.com/LeTo37/Ukulele_Player). This github repository serves to describe and detail the project a bit more as well as for version control.
