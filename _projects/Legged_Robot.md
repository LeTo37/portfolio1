## Overview
During my undergraduate degree we were tasked with building a walking legged robot.

### Specifications

The Robot had to adhere to the following specifications.

#### Construction Constraints
* The robot had to have legs, not wheels, capable of supporting and propelling the robot.
* The robot must be powered entirely off of a 9V battery and utilise no more than two low power motors.
* The robot was to be programmed in C on an STM32FO51 Micro-controller.

#### Functional Specifications
* The robot must be able to wait for a green "go" light to start moving.
* The robot must follow a black line (black tape) on the floor and stick to its path.
* The robot must be able to "see" a glue stick ahead in its path, pick up the glue stick and hoist it to the other side of the robot.
* The robot must achieve all of the above as quickly as possible.
